## Core Features
The application's core features were required to be built from the ground up, such as a shopping cart, a checkout process, a payout system, an affiliate system, a multi-tenant architecture, a wallet system, and a member dashboard.

## My Role
As the sole developer, I was able to work on backend and frontend feature implementations, including Authentication and Authorization, Database Schema, API, and UI Component Library development. 

As the project grew, so did our team. Having a bigger team allowed me to delegate tasks and focus on the backend, where I built and deployed APIs, such as a wallet feature with credit, debit, and transfer functionality. A membership system that could determine the number of discounts and commissions earned based on the membership package purchased by the user.

## Purpose
#### Why did you build this project?
#### why was it important?
#### What was the expected outcome?

This e-commerce application was my first position after attending Fullstack Academy's Software Engineering Immersive program. The biggest reason I built this project was its high complexity level. Being able to put my knowledge to the test and succeed was an incredible achievement.

## Why this Stack?

The web stack for this project was Next.js, React, Styled-components, Styled-system, Node, Express, and AWS. The reason for using Next.js was to have a server-side rendered application that would allow for SEO and better performance. The reason for using React was to have a component-based application that would allow for better code reusability and performance. The reason for using Styled-components was to have a CSS-in-JS solution that would allow for better code reusability and performance. The reason for using Styled-system was to have a CSS-in-JS solution that would allow for better code reusability and performance. The reason for using Node was to have a JavaScript runtime environment that would allow for better code reusability and performance. The reason for using Express was to have a web application framework that would allow for better code reusability and performance. The reason for using AWS was to have a cloud computing platform that would allow for better scalability and performance.

## Challenges

The challenges for this project were to build a custom e-commerce application that would allow users to build their own franchise store and sell/purchase items while earning commissions and discounts. The application also had a lot of different features that needed to be built out, such as a custom shopping cart, a custom checkout process, a custom payment system, a custom affiliate system, and a custom member dashboard.
